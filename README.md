# alexwoehr

Hello! My name is Alex Woehr. This repo is intended to be a short introduction to who I am and what I'm about.

Pull requests are welcome! Although, if your PR is untrue or otherwise unsuitable, I will definitely close it, LOL.

## Work

### Paid

I work at [3Fold Creative](http://3foldx.com). I am called "lead developer," although most of my work is as a fractional devops sysadmin. People come to us needing so many hours a month assistance for their developers, and we negotiate a retainer.

I also do work on the side from time to time. Note: the hourly rate will be high. I am insanely busy and do not have a ton of time for side projects. You may be better off contracting through 3Fold.

### Community

I spend about 10 hours a week doing math tutoring at a nonprofit called [STRIDES Tutoring](http://stridestutor.org), in Greenville, SC. I love it! We have helped over a thousand kids. We have a graduated pay scale starting very cheap, and it is based on household income. That way, families with small income can still come affordably.

90% of money donated goes to the tutor's salaries; you can see that on the 990 return. We tutor 300 kids on a budget of 70K. We have incredibly slim administrative costs. It's a wonderful organization. Donated money was never better spent than at STRIDES.

### Open Source

Most of the infrastructure scripts we use at my job are open source. Also, I am starting to help with DocPad.

## Learning

### News

Here are my favorite news sites:

- Hacker News
- Reddit
- Designer News
- sometimes I check out Behance as well
- Google Plus -- I subscribe to a bunch of communities. I ask a lot of questions and answer a lot of questions. G+ has really been excellent in its community approach, although it did steal some of the thunder from IRC and traditional mailing lists.
- Javascript Weekly
- NodeJS and iojs Weekly
- LWN.net. I read LWN cover to cover. Excellent resource for hard-core linux stuff.

### Books

Classics:
- The Pragmatic Programmer. Incredibly helpful and practical!
- The Design of Design, by Fred Brooks. My favorite book, ever.

Wannabe favorite:
- The Art of Computer Programming. Of course, you've heard of it. Still trying to come to grips with the weirdo assembly language that Knuth uses, though.

Others:
- Effective Javascript. A really great resource for people involved with Javascript. Covers a lot of dark corners that bite people from time to time. Required reading, if you are planning to do a JS library!
- Systems Programming. Brendan Gregg is a truly awesome expert on systems performance. It is actually a good introduction to how Linux and other operating systems work, although it can be tedious.
- The Linux Programming Interface. I am only about 100 pages in. This is really an awesome resource.
